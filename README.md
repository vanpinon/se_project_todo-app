# Todo APP Project 7

A Todo APP allows users to create a list of things that need to be done. The user of the app can add todos and delete todos. There is an optional due date that the user can create. There is a functional Add Todo button that the user can click to add items. The user can also create a due date for each item listed. There are error messages displayed to inform user of wrong input.

## Functionality

The webpage uses Object Oriented Programming(OOP) to organize code by encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Modular JavaScript was implemented to split the code into different files, making project more manageable. The different files that were created are FormValidator.js, Todo.js, and constants.js. JavaScript classes were also implemented to organize code into blocks.

## Technology

- Modular Javascript splits code into seperate files.
- Javascript classes divides code into blocks and includes different features:
  - instantiation - uses the new keyword to create a new object from a class
  - this keyword - refers to the object that the method is being called on
  - methods - functions defined on an object, which have access to the objects fields
  - fields - can be public and private
